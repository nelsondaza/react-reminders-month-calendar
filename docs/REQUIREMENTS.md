# Things to keep in mind for this project
 - [x] attention to details
 - [ ] cross-browser compatibility
 - [x] standards
 - [x] reusability.

Create a calendar application by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month

## Mandatory Features
 - [ ] Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.
 - [x] Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
 - [ ] Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
 - [x] Ability to edit reminders â€“ including changing text, city, day, time and color.
 - [ ] Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
 - [x] Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

### Bonus (Optional)
 - [ ] Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.
 - [x] Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
 - [ ] Functionality to delete one or ALL the reminders for a specific day

## Considerations
 - [x] Redux (or any other state manager) structure of the calendar.
 - [x] The project is totally focused on the front-end; please ignore the back-end.
 - [x] Keep your code versioned with Git.
 - [x] Feel free to use small helper libraries for:
   - UI Elements.
   - Date/Time handling.
 - [x] You must create the calendar component yourself. Do not use calendar libraries like FullCalendar or Bootstrap Calendar.
 - [ ] If you use an external API, make sure to provide working API keys.
